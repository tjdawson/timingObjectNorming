    <p>We are interested in how children learn their first words, by noticing the situations in which the words are uttered by adults. As a first step to understanding this, we are asking how easily adults like yourself can identify word meanings just by looking at what's happening when words are said, without hearing the other words in the sentence.</p>
    <p>You will be watching a series of short videos in which parents interact with their young children, speaking naturally and using the kinds of sentences that are typical when talking to small children &ndash; simple sentences with simple, common words.</p>
    <p>In each video, we have picked out one word that occurred in the parents' speech to their child that we want you to try to guess. The sound will be absent from these videos, so you will not be able to hear what the parent was actually saying. However, each time the parent uttered a given English word (e.g., "unicorn"), we have inserted a 'mystery word' (e.g., "blick"). For example, suppose in one of the videos a parent was saying "Let's look at the book about unicorns and mermaids." If the word we have selected is "unicorn", you would hear the word "blick" at exactly the moment when the word "unicorn" was uttered by the parent in the video. (Note: "unicorn" is just an example and is NOT one of the words in the videos we will show you today.)</p>
