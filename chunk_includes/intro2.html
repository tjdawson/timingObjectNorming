    <h2>There are two parts to this study: one conducted here and the other to be completed at home over the internet.</h2>
    <h3>Part 2: You will need to complete this part of the study between 10 -14 hours after the start of Part 1.</h3>
    <p>For example, if you came into the lab to watch videos at 8 PM, you need to complete the survey link sometime after 6 AM and before 10 AM. In this part of the study we will be asking you questions about the videos you see today. A link to the survey will be provided to you along with your unique ID information. At the end of today's session, you will also have the opportunity to email the link to yourself.</p>
    <p>At this time, please turn off your cell phones and anything else that might disrupt the experiment, and close all other computer programs, as well as all browser tabs and windows except for this one. Let the experimenter know if you have any questions. Then, click the link below to proceed.</p>
